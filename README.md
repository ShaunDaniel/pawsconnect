This is a personal project under development, So some features may not work as expected.

This is a personal project that I'm currently working on as a part of my journey learning the MERN stack. This website allows users to register themselves & add animals (dogs/cats) available for adoption with their contact number. Similarly, users who wish to adopt a pet can contact people who've added pets to the site. 

Once I have enough confidence with the workflow of the site, I'll deploy it.
